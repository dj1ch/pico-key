# pico key
A POC using python and circuitpython to exploit a target machine. This is just a bare repository which I plan on changing over time. 

### Intro
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a flexible microcontroller board designed for multiple purposes. With this project I intend to use make a powerful Keystroke Injection tool for such an intricate board with a special purpose. It is designed to be easy to configure, modify, and use for fun. This will be designed to be a little more than a *Bad USB*.

### Development progress
This [project](https://github.com/users/dj1ch/projects/3) showcases my progress thus far. I am going to restart this project from scratch as I figure out what to do. Most of my ideas for this project have been used for other ones. 

### Install guide
TBA, I don't plan on making an install guide until everything is set up. 

### The attack: explained
Might change how it works soon.

**Before asking to install, this is merely a blueprint for what I will be working on for the next couple weeks!**

### FAQ
TBA 

### Contributing
